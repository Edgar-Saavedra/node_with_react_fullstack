## Stack
This is the general stack and what each technology does.

- **Backend**:
  - MongoDB for database
  - Express Framework for application
    - We build an Express API to take requests and talks to mongodb and returning data from our API to the frontend
  - Node.js: the base language and enviroment (javascript)

- **Front-end**:
  - React.js for building dynamic components and HTML
    - All requests talking through AJAX and JSON
    - our react application will not talk directly to mongo db
  - Redux: a library for react js to create single page applications.
  - CSS: for styling our site.
- **Extra**
  - OAUTH : for authenticating with goolge
  - Stripe : for taking credit cards
